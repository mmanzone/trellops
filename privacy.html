        <h1>🔒 Privacy Disclaimer for Trellops</h1>
        
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Disclaimer outlines how Trellops (the "Service"), provided by manzone.org, handles user data in relation to the third-party service, Trello (owned by Atlassian).</p>
        <p>Your privacy is paramount. We strive to be transparent about what data we access and, crucially, what data we do not store.</p>

        <h2>2. Data Accessed and Purpose</h2>
        <p>Trellops is a display service designed to present information and data stored within your personal Trello account.</p>
        <p><strong>Trello Data Access:</strong> The Service requires you to log in to your Trello account via Trello's official authentication process (using an OAuth token). This grants Trellops read-only access to the Trello boards, cards, and associated data you authorise. This access is strictly used to retrieve and display the information to you during your session.</p>
        <p><strong>No Data Storage on Developer Servers:</strong> Trellops does not store, copy, archive, or transmit any data retrieved from your Trello account onto our own developer servers or any cloud-based storage owned by manzone.org. All retrieved Trello information is processed in real-time solely within your web browser.</p>

        <h2>3. Local Storage and Session Management</h2>
        <p>To provide a functional and seamless user experience, Trellops utilises local storage technologies on your device (e.g., browser cookies, local storage, or session storage).</p>
        <p><strong>Information Stored Locally:</strong> This local storage is used to securely hold essential information necessary for the Service to operate, which may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your Trello API/OAuth token for the duration of your session.</li>
            <li>Session IDs and other temporary settings (e.g., preferred view, display preferences).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Local-Only Storage:</strong> This information is stored only on your computer or device and is not accessible by, or transmitted back to, manzone.org's servers or Trello/Atlassian beyond the initial Trello API calls necessary to fetch the data.</p>
        <p><strong>Security:</strong> Once you log out or close your session, this locally stored session data (including the Trello token) is typically invalidated or removed, requiring a fresh login for the next use.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Links and Trello's Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Trellops relies entirely on the Trello platform. Any data stored in Trello is subject to Trello/Atlassian's own privacy policy and terms of service. We strongly encourage you to review their policies regarding the storage and security of your data.</p>

        <h2>5. Changes to This Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Disclaimer from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new disclaimer on this page.</p>
